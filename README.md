# lancer-led-lamp
trying to make a 3d printable lamp using the lancer rpg logo

## TODO
need to make this larger (line across text has no cavity, which i think will affect light).  Printer bed is limiting factor for size, so also need to devise way to link all cavities together and cut the model into pieces to fit.
